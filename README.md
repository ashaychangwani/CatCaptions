# Cat Captions

This is a React native application (and can thus run natively on iOS, Android and on Web) that allows you to generate captions to photos of your pet.

However, this is done smartly, using the power of CV to identify the context provided by the picture, and using NLP to generate a caption that is relevant to the context.

Thus, the captions are tailored to the picture, and are not just random words.

## Inspiration
One of our members runs a fishkeeping Instagram account with weekly posts, but coming up with a witty, creative caption becomes a challenge after a while with ideas getting used up. This is where an AI-powered app like CatCaptions comes in handy, since it generates a virtually inexhaustible supply of funny texts that help entertain followers.

## What it does
Simply pick an image from your camera roll, wait, and voila! 5 beautiful, autogenerated captions just waiting to be used. Choose one, copy to your clipboard or get it sent right to you via text message and post!

On a more technical note, the image is sent to an API, where it is processed by Cohere and ChatGPT. The models then give it a few possible captions, and these are sent back to the user by text using Twilio.
## How we built it
We used React Native for the frontend and an API that accesses Cohere and ChatGPT for the backend. 
For the backend, we first use Lavis Models to extract the context or description of this image. This context is then fed to a NLP model like GPT along with some prompt engineering to generate witty captions that would be used for apps like Instagram. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made it, the amazing React Native App we are pround of!
An incredibly powerful AI backend that generates context right from the picture and NLP model to use the context to generate captions.
